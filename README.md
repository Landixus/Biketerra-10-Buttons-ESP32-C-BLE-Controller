Biketerra 10 Buttons ESP32-C BLE Controller for Handlebar custom Mount

This Sketch is for ESP32C Dev Module, i use a geekable: https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005007104801519.html

Settings in Arduino IDE:
Board ESP32C3 DEV Modul
Downgrade with Boardmanager to esp32 2.0.17 for Espressif
Upload with DIO | 115200 | CDC Enabled on boot

Make sure you have "ESP32_BLE_Keyboard" library without other "ESP32_XX_BLE_Keyboard_XX" libraries

My Modul is really trick and instable, mayBe use a nodemcu32 with BLE.

The buttons are arranged for BikeTerra, feel free to arrange for your needs.

Wiring Screenshots come later.

The device go to sleep after 5 minutes, and can be waked up with left Button, if still tired, just reset the modul.
Dont forget to add the device in your Bluetooth manager as Lenkrad Pro :)
If you load a new Sketch to the device, kick it out of your windows BT Managaer before you try to upload the sketch.
